    <p class="paragraph">This robot, created for FIRST Tech Challenge&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Goal&quot; game, was the first project where I did all of the robot&#x27;s programming in addition to mechanical design. I completed a full robot assembly in SolidWorks before building, and I also opted to build a simpler proof-of-concept robot first. This helped to test core mechanisms like the single-flywheel launcher before I moved on to more complex designs like the turret system that rotates the launcher. There were no actual Ultimate Goal competitions due to the pandemic.<br>‍<br></p>
    <div class="image"><img src="images/ezgif-4-82da6a8ba3.gif" loading="lazy" alt="">
      <p class="paragraph-2">The first prototype launcher - I built it in about an hour. The 3D-printed wall pieces had slotted screwholes to allow the compression of the foam disc to be adjusted; here they had become rather loose from the flywheel vibration.</p><img src="images/IMG_0638.HEIC.jpg" loading="lazy" width="502" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 98vw, 49vw" srcset="images/IMG_0638.HEIC-p-500.jpg 500w, images/IMG_0638.HEIC-p-800.jpg 800w, images/IMG_0638.HEIC-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/IMG_0638.HEIC-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/IMG_0638.HEIC-p-2000.jpg 2000w, images/IMG_0638.HEIC-p-2600.jpg 2600w, images/IMG_0638.HEIC.jpg 2681w" alt="">
      <p class="paragraph-2">An early turret prototype. The discs were loaded horizontally onto a platter, and then a servo tilted them up to match the angle of the flywheel. </p><img src="images/ezgif-4-b2c3529f42.gif" loading="lazy" alt="">
      <p class="paragraph-2">Slow-motion clip of three discs (the maximum the robot can possess at once) being launched. An servo-actuated arm, not seen here, pushes each ring from the back. The end of the clip shows the ring platter fold down into its loading position; rings would then inserted from the intake. The final set of grey silicone intake wheels can be seen to the right, as well as a lever that prevents rings from bouncing out of the platter after they have been loaded. </p><img src="images/intake2.gif" loading="lazy" alt="">
      <p class="paragraph-2">An early test (actual speed) of the intake. A spring-loaded roller with silicone wheels contacts the rings first; they are then funneled to the center of the robot.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-2">Later prototypes showed that having the discs travel in an arc around the flywheel was unnecessary, so the launcher could be more compact. Here I was testing whether the relatively light flighwheel could maintain enough speed to rapid-fire discs at a consistent velocity.</p><img src="images/IMG_0804.HEIC.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 98vw, 49vw" srcset="images/IMG_0804.HEIC-p-500.jpg 500w, images/IMG_0804.HEIC-p-800.jpg 800w, images/IMG_0804.HEIC-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/IMG_0804.HEIC-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/IMG_0804.HEIC-p-2000.jpg 2000w, images/IMG_0804.HEIC-p-2600.jpg 2600w, images/IMG_0804.HEIC.jpg 2912w" alt="">
      <p class="paragraph-2">The robot&#x27;s mecanum drivetrain. Note the 3 free-spinning odometry wheel modules, which provide a means for measuring the robot&#x27;s location and heading.</p><img src="images/ezgif-4-eebd7863a4.gif" loading="lazy" alt="">
      <p class="paragraph-2">The turret mounted to a prototype drivetrain. I later decided to omit the turret functionality in my first proof-of-concept robot, as it would be too difficult to load it with discs using a simpler intake. </p>

    <p class="paragraph-2">Each Ultimate Goal game started with a 30-second period in which the robot completes tasks autonomously. Here I used the free-spinning wheels shown in the drivetrain photo above to track the robot&#x27;s location on the field. An early version of my custom motion-planning library determined how to apply power to the drive motors to follow a predefined path. The hardest autonomous tasks were the &quot;Powershots&quot; - the blue pegs at the beginning that have to be knocked down by launching discs - they were such a small target to hit in comparison to the regular goal. </p>

    <p class="paragraph-2"> Here&#x27;s a video of me testing the more ambitious robot design during the portion of the game where the robot is controlled by a human. Another person (the &quot;human player&quot;) returns discs that have been launched into the goal by rolling them down a chute. One significant barrier to faster disc collection was preventing rolling rings from just bouncing off the front of the robot. I had partially solved this issue in the video above by using fast-spinning silicone tubes at the front of the intake; they could apply just enough force to pull rolling rings against the front of the robot. </p>
